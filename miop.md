# Minimum information about an Omics Protocol (MIOP)

Terms and related documentation from the Minimal Information about an Omics Protocol (MIOP) specification

These terms were developed by the Better Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BeBOP) group coming out of the [Task Team 21-03: Omics/eDNA Protocol Management](https://www.oceanbestpractices.org/about/task-teams/obps-task-team-21-03-omics-edna-protocol-management/) under the Ocean Best Practices System.


Please consult [model/schema/terms.yaml](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/miop/blob/main/model/schema/terms.yaml) for the term specifications
